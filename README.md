## Mining Job Advertisements from Historical Newspapers

This repository contains scripts for extracting information on wages in nineteenth-century job advertisements, printed in digitized historical newspapers. The newspapers are extraced by using the [National Library API](https://www.kb.nl/bronnen-zoekwijzers/dataservices-en-apis). Newspapers printed before 1876 are free of copyrights. Mining newspapers printed after 1876 requires an API-key.
